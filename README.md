# provider-enrollment-form

In the healtcare industry, manage care organizations receive a large number 
of requests from providers to join the Medicaid network. Instead of processing
paper interested provider forms, my company has created a webform application
to manage all of the incoming requests. For educational purposes, I wanted to 
try to mimic the features of this app with my own PHP code.
